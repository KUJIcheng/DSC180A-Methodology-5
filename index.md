## Reflection Questions

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
I believe the most interesting topic during the quarter is figure out how the Transformer learn from different kind of data. Mover, Trainning a LLMs model with mutiple GPU is cool.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
We are trying to create some scaffolding toolkits to help others better explore the various parameters of large language models and quickly understand the hardware resources required to train and reason about a model. In addition, we are also trying to make some extensions on training some large models, such as making language models perform better in specific fields.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
In fact, we spent most of the first quarter learning and understanding the details of the large language model, understanding the role and function of each part. Then we will do something new in the second semester based on this knowledge. We have discussed whether we need to adopt multimodal training, which is different from what we are currently doing.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
Because training large language models requires a lot of resources, we have tried to use some special solutions to reduce the accuracy while minimizing the impact on model performance.
